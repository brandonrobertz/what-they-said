Why not topic modeling?
Because for a person who says so much, he actually says very little

Remaining areas for improvement:
- Fine tune number of clusters -- there are too many catch-all clusters (3-4)

Idea for visualization:
- Start with comparison analysis of trump rally speech vs some other similar speech/rally
  - Find a proper metric for this. Word count vs vocab on such small texts doesn't show much.
- Yules K/I:
  - Doesn't provide much more information than what I get with \frac{vocab_{unique}}{N_{words}}

Lets avoid:
1. spending a ton of time poorly explaining machine learning algorithms:

2. conjecturing without data and analysis:
